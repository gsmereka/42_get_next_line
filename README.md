# 42_get_next_line
The get_next_line function aims to efficiently read lines from a file or standard input. It can be useful in any situation where it is necessary to read a file line by line, such as processing log files, reading configuration files or inputting user data in an organized manner.
The function is called repeatedly to read each line of the file and returns the read line as a string. If there is nothing left to read or an error occurs, the function returns NULL. In addition, the function is able to handle files that do not end with a newline character appropriately. This makes it a useful and versatile tool for reading files in C.
